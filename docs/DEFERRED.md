# Deferred — questions, deviations, skipped items

Every entry: spec · checkpoint · what · why deferred · what was done instead.

## Run setup (orchestrator)

- **run · setup · `docs/CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOW.md` does not exist.** The run prompt says to read
  it. Nothing to read; proceeded with CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md and the specs.
- **run · setup · `docs/handoffs/003.md` does not exist**, and neither did `docs/handoffs/`. The
  prompt says handoffs follow 003.md's shape. Shape taken from the prompt instead: status, what
  exists now, conventions, decisions the next spec must make, known debts, lessons.
- **run · setup · specs define no checkpoints.** The orchestrator split each spec into
  checkpoints along its own sections (domain + data model → application/API → web → E2E),
  keeping each near the ~200-line diff guideline. The split is listed per spec in STATUS.md.
- **run · setup · cloud Linux environment, not Windows.** .NET SDK 10.0.401 (pinned by
  global.json) installed from packages.microsoft.com's Debian 12 feed into /opt/dotnet,
  because builds.dotnet.microsoft.com is blocked by the egress proxy. Playwright expected
  Chromium build 1243; the preinstalled build 1194 was symlinked in its place. E2E runs against
  database `financas_e2e` via user-secrets (Google keys are dummies; E2E uses dev-login).
  None of this is committed — it is environment, not repo.
- **run · setup · orchestrator read the specs just-in-time.** ARCHITECTURE.md ADRs, 004 and
  005 were read up front; 006–010 are read when each spec starts, to keep the orchestrator's
  context small. Each subagent reads its own spec in full.

## 005 · checkpoint 1

- **005 · CP1 · unit test 3 ("Rule 3 with Transfer rejects zero") — ambiguity.** 003's
  design reports zero once, from rule 1 (`ValidateAmount`), and keeps rule 3 (`ValidateSign`)
  silent on zero so the `amount` field is not reported twice. Simplest reading kept: the test
  asserts `ValidateAmount(0)` fails and `ValidateSign(0, Transfer)` is null. A zero Transfer is
  still refused by every endpoint, which call both rules.
- **005 · CP1 · unit test 4 — no new test.** 003's unit test 7
  (`Sign_must_agree_with_the_category_kind`, all four Income/Expense combinations) already is
  test 4; its doc comment now says so. Unchanged and still green.
- **005 · CP1 · `openingBalance` on PUT — ambiguity.** Amendment 3 says "default 0". Chosen:
  optional (`decimal?`) on both routes; omitted on create → 0, omitted on update → the stored
  value is kept (same pattern as `currency`). Any sign accepted (a card starts negative).
  Rounded to 2 places `ToEven` like `Money`, so the response matches what `numeric(18,2)`
  stores. No upper-bound check: a value beyond `numeric(18,2)` would be a 500, as it already
  is for transaction amounts.
- **005 · CP1 · `docs/migrations/` did not exist.** Created it for `005-AddDashboard.sql`.
- **005 · CP1 · flaky test observed.** One full run failed
  `TransactionPersistenceTests` (two `Amount_round_trips_byte_identical` cases and the timezone
  test) before any implementation touched them; they passed in isolation and on every rerun.
  Not investigated further.

## 005 · checkpoint 2

- **005 · CP2 · Dapper 2.1.89** (latest stable on nuget.org at the time), restored through the
  proxy with no extra setup. No migration in this checkpoint.
- **005 · CP2 · where the code lives.** `Application/Dashboard/DashboardQueries.cs` (a scoped
  class taking `AppDbContext`, ADR-016; SQL as `internal const` raw string literals so the tests
  can run them) and `Shares.cs`; routes in `Endpoints/DashboardEndpoints.cs`. The BRL-only total,
  `excludedFromTotal`, `net` and the share rounding live in `Application/`, not the endpoint.
- **005 · CP2 · income and expense sum BRL rows only.** The spec restricts `total` to BRL but is
  silent on `month`, `monthly` and `by-category`. Summing two currencies is the bug `Money`
  exists to stop (ARCHITECTURE.md §4), so every income/expense aggregation filters
  `"Currency" = 'BRL'` (as a parameter). Foreign-currency activity is invisible there until
  currency conversion exists.
- **005 · CP2 · signs as stored.** `expense` and every Expense `amount` in `by-category` are
  negative; `net = income + expense`. `share` is positive (amount / sum of amounts, same sign).
- **005 · CP2 · `share` uses largest-remainder rounding** to 4 places, so shares sum to exactly
  1.0000 (spec test 17 allows 0.0001 of drift; three equal thirds would otherwise sum to
  0.9999). Every share stays within 0.0001 of the exact value. All shares are 0 if the sum is 0.
- **005 · CP2 · `months` below 1 is clamped up to 1**, symmetric with the clamp to 36 and with
  the transactions page size ("an oversized page is a caller being greedy, not wrong"). A
  non-integer `months` is a 400 on field `months`.
- **005 · CP2 · parameters bound as strings.** `month`, `months` and `kind` are parsed in the
  endpoint so every malformed value is a 400 with a pt-BR message naming the field, rather than
  the framework's English binding failure. `month` must match `YYYY-MM` exactly (`2026-9` is
  refused). `kind` accepts `Income`/`Expense` by name (case-insensitive) and defaults to
  `Expense`; `Transfer` and `2` get a message explaining transfers are neither; any other value
  (including other numbers) gets the generic message. `by-category` reports `month` and `kind`
  errors together.
- **005 · CP2 · "current month" is the UTC calendar month**, the same clock
  `TransactionRules.ValidateDate` uses. For a few hours at the turn of a month it differs from
  Brasília's; the web sends `month` explicitly whenever it matters.
- **005 · CP2 · SQL defence in depth.** Besides the mandated `"UserId" = @userId` on the driving
  table, joined `Transactions`/`Categories` are also constrained to the user. Month arithmetic
  casts `date` to `timestamp` explicitly, so PostgreSQL never picks the `timestamptz` overload
  of `date_trunc`/`generate_series` and the session timezone cannot move a row between months.
- **005 · CP2 · test 6** scans every `.cs`/`.sql` file under `api/Application/Dashboard/`: each
  raw string literal containing SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE must contain `"UserId" = @userId`,
  at least three such statements must exist, and a SQL keyword in an ordinary (non-raw) string
  literal fails the test, so SQL cannot dodge the check by being written another way. The
  decimal-mapping test runs each SQL constant untyped through Dapper and asserts every money
  column arrives as `decimal`; a third test asserts no type in the namespace has a
  `double`/`float` property.
- **005 · CP2 · extra tests beyond the plan:** 401 without a session, the 400 cases for every
  parameter, `months` of 36/0/-5/omitted, and `by-category` honouring `month`.
- **005 · CP2 · root cause of CP1's "flaky" `TransactionPersistenceTests`.** Not flaky: the
  suite exhausted Linux's default `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` (128). Every test host
  watched appsettings and user-secrets files, and once the limit was hit later hosts failed in
  `WebApplication.CreateBuilder` with an `IOException`. The dashboard tests pushed the run over
  the edge deterministically (15-16 failures). Fixed in `IdentityApiFactory` with
  `UseSetting("hostBuilder:reloadConfigOnChange", "false")`; the full suite is green again.
- **005 · CP2 · observed, not fixed (out of scope):** `api/Program.cs`,
  `Domain/IUserOwned.cs`, `Domain/Transactions/Category.cs`, `Domain/Transactions/Money.cs`,
  `Infrastructure/AuthenticationSetup.cs` and `Infrastructure/GoogleUserInfo.cs` contain
  non-ASCII (em dashes) with no UTF-8 BOM, against the CLAUDE.md rule. All occurrences are in
  comments, so nothing compiles wrong; adding the BOMs is a one-line chore for a later
  checkpoint.
